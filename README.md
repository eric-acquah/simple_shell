# simple_shell

Implementation of a simple shell program by Chioma Ukora and Eric Acquah

This is a very basic version of the earlier 'sh' shell program developed for the
initial versions of the Unix Operating System.
This marks the final low level project assigned to us as part of our foundational
stage of the ALX software engineering programme.

In this project we are to develop the fundamental processes that the shell
command interpreter carries out to execute a program. Therefore, advance features
like arithmetic expansions, command substitution, bracket expansions, conditional
statements, job control among others will not be implemented.

We aim to develop a modular program that will be scalable enough to receive
newer features as time goes by. The program is intended to be safe, bug free and
memory effecient. Nonetheless, there maybe a few abnormalities encountered while
running the program, which is absolutely unintentional. We are new to programming
and anyone who find such errors should kindly draw our attention to it.

<h4>The entire project can be categorized into three modules;</h4>

*Prompting and Reading<br>
*Parsing and command recognition<br>
*Execution
